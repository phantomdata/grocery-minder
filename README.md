# GroceryMinder

## Status

Currently un-usable.  I'm actively working on this project to build
out features.

## Introduction

This is a little .NET application to aid in tracking recurring grocery
purchases.  The goal is to address those "We're out of toilet paper"
moments by reminding you to buy it on your infrequent basis.  I mean,
I hope you don't buy toilet paper everytime you go to the store.  Stop
pooping so much.

I'm building this out to support notifications and weekly or semi-weekly
shopping lists being mailed out to a user.  That way you can know exactly
what you should buy from the store to keep your normal stock running well.
